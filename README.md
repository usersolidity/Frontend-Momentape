## General Information

- Project:
The project is made on React with Typescript mostly. We used several sponsors technologies : Ceramic, ENS, Livepeer, IPFS/Filecoin and Unlock. We deployed the website on Fleek. The sponsors made us re think the original idea that you can find in the "Long Description". It was supposed to be a NFT marketplace, but for the hackathon it's now a live streaming platform, in the web3, for creators (YouTubers, Instagramers etc.)

- Userjourney Creators :
They can connect their wallet. Then, creators can edit their profile (cover pic, bio, links, etc.) with data imported from YouTube. They can prepare their next stream => price, date, time etc.
- Userjourney Users :
They can connect their wallet. Then, users can directly go to a creator's page to discorver his/her universe, or they can also directly watch one of the next livestream drops. Once users are on a stream page, they will have to pay to unlock the access to the artist live.
